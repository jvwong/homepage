          Commissioned by the journal Cell Cycle, I authored a review 
          describing the role of the E2F network in maintaining the precision
          clockwork underlying cell division. The challenge here was in integrating
          and conveying a unifying message from the voluminous, often contradictory
          threads of research over two decades. An excerpt from the abstract:
          <br>
          <blockquote>The challenge to understand how E2F dynamics coordinate molecular events
          required for high-fidelity DNA replication has great biological
          implications. Indeed, precocious, prolonged, elevated or reduced
          accumulation of E2F can generate replication stress that culminates
          in either arrest or death. Accordingly, temporal characteristics of
          E2F are regulated by several network modules that include feedforward
          and autoregulatory loops. In this review, we discuss how these network
          modules contribute to “shaping” E2F dynamics in the context of mammalian
          cell cycle entry</blockquote>

The cells were all infected with the same adenovirus, but their responses differed, as indicated by the range of reddish colors. The nuclei of the cells are seen in blue and pink. This picture, rendered artistically in a "stained glass" imaging technique, was created by post-doctoral fellow Jeffrey Wong in the biomedical engineering lab of Lingchong You as part of a study on how identical stimuli can cause unique responses.

               We were commissioned by Nature to provide a "News &amp; Views" article reviewing
               work by Chris Voigt's group. Previously, single strains of bacteria were engineered
               to perform simple tasks in response to chemical signals, such as performing logical opertaions analagous to
               those performed by digital electronics. In this case, Voigt's group split up the work between multiple
               engineered strains, allowing researchers to mix-and-match strains to perform ever more complex
               tasks. Though my authorship was punted from the final publication (Nature has a 2-author limit), my idea for a graphical summary of the Voigt lab's work
               did manage to worm its way into the article (left - published graphic; right- my original drawing).

            p53 is often referred to as the "Guardian of the Genome" due to it's proposed ability to
            monitor DNA damage that can contribute to the genesis of diseases such as cancer. A flurry of research in the last
            three decades has implicated p53 in the control of hundreds if not thousands of genes.
            Early findings were consistent with the notion that p53 could physically bind to genes and
            change their expression levels, in this way influencing the tendency of cells to either repair
            or kill themselves off.
        </p>
        <p>
            A curious aspect p53 control of genes is the generic nature of the DNA target it binds to:
            A p53 "consensus" is a 10 base-pair repeat separated by a variable "linker" region (top of figure below).
            Adding to the confusion is the tremendous variation in what sequences are actually functional in response to p53.
            Based off of our earlier findings linking p53 and PTGF-beta (next section)
            we wished to dissect the exact nature of how p53 controls PTGF-beta expression.
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/publication/promoter_jbc.png" /><br>
        <p>
            In this report, we identified two canonical p53 binding sites in the sequences close to the PTGF-beta gene (p53-1 and p53-2
            in the figure above). I used a panel of classical molecular biology tricks to show that one of the sites
            plays a dominant role in the reponse while the other is much less responsive. This functional activity was
            reflected in the amount of p53 we could see bound to each site. This was convincing
            evidence of a direct link between the vast p53 and TGF-beta networks in the cell, both of which
            have critical roles in a variety of cellular processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the process of "bashing" the control regions of PTGF-beta to isolate
            p53-response regions, we noticed that removing a particular section could actually sensitize PTGF-beta
            to p53, an effect that had not previously been described. The figure below shows a rather ancient
            technique called electrophoretic mobility gel-shift assay (EMSA) which is used to isolate regions of DNA
            that bind to proteins. The shaded region in figure below indicated the p53TRE we mapped out near the PTGF-beta gene.
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/publication/emsa.png" /><br>
        <p>
            The take home message from this study was a two-fold: One, a direct link established between p53 and TGF-beta
            signalling pathways and two, the presence of a complex set of DNA control sequences determining the quantitative
            nature of this response. We speculated that these positive and negative regulatory sequences might restrict
            full activation of PTGF-beta to high levels of p53 that would be present
            with persistent/severe DNA damage.

        <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/275/26/20127.long">
            <span class="reference">The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 30 June 2000, 275(26): pp.20127-20135</span>
        </a>
        <p>
            Dr. Pei-Xiang Li, a postdoc in or group at the time, reported the identification of a novel gene
            Placental Transforming Growth Factor beta (PTGF-beta). Since publication,
            this cell-cell communication molecule has been implicated in the response
            to a vast array of stimuli spanning non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents to resveratrol (the
            proposed wonder ingredient in red wine) to ionizing radiation. In addition, PTGF-beta has
            been proposed to as a valuable biomarker for cancer and cardiovascular risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time, our group was interested in finding genes activated by cancer therapies including
            radiation as well as chemical DNA damaging agents. Pei-Xiang screened breast cancer-derived cells to identify
            PTGF-beta from what is now an now ancient technique referred to as "differential display". The figure below
            shows our confirmation that this gene was indeed activated by radiation (Rad) and by p53, which plays
            a critical role in the response to DNA damage.
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/publication/radiation.jpg" /><br>
        <p>
            The response to both radiation and p53 led to the question of whether PTGF-beta could be a downstream mediator
            of p53 activity, whose ability to initiate cell death ("apoptosis") or cell cycle arrest has been well-documented.
            I performed promoter analyses that showed a direct link between p53 and the DNA sequences controlling PTGF-beta levels.
            In addition, flow cytometry results below demonstrated that another adenovirus expressing PTGF-beta (AdPTGF-B) but not
            control (AdBgal) could potentiate the arrested state (i.e. large G1/S ratio).
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/publication/flow.jpg" /><br>
        <p>
            This work was important for several reasons. First, it identified a novel downstream mediator of p53, which is a
            critical gene at the nexus of the proper response to potentially cancer-causing DNA damage. Next, it linked the
            p53 and TGF-beta pathways, which play ubiquitous roles in cell growth and development. Third, it demonstrated
            PTGF-beta was sufficient to induce cell death. This last fact, coupled with the knowledge that PTGF-beta is an
            extracellular protein make it an attractive target for cancer gene therapy: It's ability to kill cells from the outside
            in would obviate the need to deliver the payload to every single cell. It hs been exciting
            to see the discoveries that built upon PTGF-beta's discovery.
