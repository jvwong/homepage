          The word "noise" can mean a lot of things to different people. To most, it's an annoying
          aspect of daily life that comes at us in the form of loud sounds. To a statistics major, its the
          irreducible variability in prediction error; For a physicist, it's the randomness in
          reactions that arise from thermal fluctuations. Mostly, it's just stuff we can't (or can't be bothered to)
          explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The notion of noisiness has had a renaissance in biology stoked by observations that we could
          both <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/297/5584/1183.abstract">see and measure</a> differences
          between seemingly identical cells. However, there are many instances in which "hidden" variables
          can <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v12/n2/full/nrm3044.html"> explain away</a>
          a lot of ostensibly random behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been interested in a class of bacteria that contaminate food and make humans sick by burrowing through intestinal
          cells. We have shown that when these bacteria invade humans it can be horribly variable.
          Below are microscope images of genetically identical HeLa cells, some harboring many bacteria
          (bright green spots; GFP) adjacent those with none. Why the difference?
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/invasion_fluorescent.png" /><br>
        <p>
          We had two pieces of evidence. First, invasion depends on successive, increasingly strong interactions
          between hosts and pathogen receptors (proteins that stick out of their surfaces) reminiscent of a zipper.
          Second, even genetically identical hosts have a distribution of receptors. So, we thought that
          the amount of invasion would be proportional to receptor number but that the great sensitivity would
          magnify event the tiniest differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are some experiments where we either did not (left, top) or did (left, bottom)
          infect host cells with bacteria tagged with fluorescent proteins. We wanted to pick out infected from
          uninfected cells, but the difficulty is that the light signals we used to track them overlap.
          So we turned to a statistical modeling technique called the expectation-maximization
          (EM) algorithm to pick out uninfected (black) from infected (red) host cells by assuming the existence
          of Gaussian distributions describing each sub-population. This probabilistic classification technique
          enabled us to calculate the rotation (i.e. major axis) of each cloud through principal component analysis
          (red, right). The slight rotation in the major axis - up and to the right - indicated that indeed,
          increasing host receptor number is proportional to bacterial uptake.
        </p><br>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/pca_flow.png" />
        <br>
        <p>
          A primary goal of modeling is to provide a concise description. Based upon our
          observations and knowledge of the literature around uptake, we were able to distill a simple
          power-law describing the how the probability of bacterial invasion depends on receptor number. This
          model has but two parameters, which is orders of magnitude simpler than the numerous factors known
          to affect uptake.
        </p><br>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/power_law.png" />
        <p>
          So is that it? Two parameters? Well not really. There is still a tremendous amount of variation in uptake
          for cells with the same amount of receptor. It remains to be seen what other factors can explain away
          the differences in invasion. Maybe noise. Maybe not.

          The ubiquity of mobile electronic devices has probably taught us one thing: Multitasking
          results in poor performance and is potentially dangerous!
          This computational analysis examines how this notion applies to biological signaling networks.
          The E2F network (figure below) which controls cell growth has been shown to multitask:
          It performs different functions in cells depending on the type of stimulus it receives
          (e.g. growth factor versus MYC cancer gene activation).
          These different functions are produced by the same network exhibiting different dynamics
          (hysteresis, biphasic, adaptation). We were interested in seeing
          what trade-offs, if any, accompanied a network trying to accomplish this many jobs.
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/e2fNetwork.png" /><br>
        <p>
          Our approach was two-fold. First, we developed an algorithm that could learn
          typical parameter values which allowed our network to perform each "task".
          Second, we defined two measures of network performance: "Tension" was calculated by how far
          task-specific parameters sets were from one another; "Robustness", described how resilient parameters were
          to minor perturbation. A major challenge here was to convey the changes in the high-dimensional
          parameter space in a simple yet meaningful fashion.
        </p><br>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/parameterChange.png" />
        <br>
        <p>
          The above figure conveys the tension between a hysteretic response (baseline value) and a biphasic response.
          That is, the same network can operate function differently by modulating a subset of it's parameters,
          while leaving others largely unchanged.
          An alternative to this strategy is to find a middle ground - a single set of parameter values that accommodates
          multiple tasks. While we could identify such parameter values, they were much more sensitive to minor perturbations,
          and so less robust. This report shows that the amount of multitasking a network takes on may be limited by
          the amount of fragility it experiences in the process.

        <p>
          We all start from one, single, lonely cell; Given the fact that our bodies will be made of nearly
          100 trillion cells over a lifetime, it's pretty miraculous that we all don't get cancer
          sooner! This suggests some pretty good safety valves in place to prevent uncontrolled
          cell growth. Here we report a built-stopping mechanism in the E2F network that controls cell growth
          that is triggered by dangerous levels of growth signals originating from the MYC cancer gene.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this report, we wanted to examine how different amounts of the MYC gene affected the cell cycle response,
          as measured by the amount of E2F gene produced. E2F lies at the nexus of a network
          that governs the transition from resting to proliferation. MYC is induced by normal
          growth signals but is also produced in great excess in human tumours, leading to the theory that
          it's persistent activation contributes to cancer.The figure below shows microscope images of a single attempt to
          deliver different amounts of MYC to rat cells and measure E2F. The figure shows experiments where we
          deliver MYC (mCherry in red) at increasing levels to cells (DAPI in blue) and then track E2F (GFP in green).
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/modelling_confocal.png" /><br>
        <p>
          We automated the above technique so that we could track the MYC input (x-axis) and E2F
          output (y-axis) in hundreds of thousands of individual cells (data points) in one shot! Successive panels
          show results when the average doses of MYC was dialed up. These experiments revealed a heretofore unnoticed
          phenomenon: low MYC generates low E2F while high levels also leads to low levels!
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/scatterMolCell.png" /><br>
        <p>
          To help understand this behaviour better, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model of the wider MYC-E2F
          network to determine what was required to recapitulate our observations (figure below). The panel on the left
          shows the simplified network that we modelled having normal growth signals activating MYC which, in turn, upregulates
          E2F. Consistent with <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/v10/n4/abs/ncb1711.html">previous work</a>, our model
          could generate the induction of E2F by MYC but could not generate the suppression at high MYC levels (right panel, grey trajectory).
          Indeed, our model indicated that other known suppressors of E2F downstream of MYC could not generate this behaviour,
          and that an additional source of repression must exist (right panel, green trajectory), the nature of which remains unknown.
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/modelling/modelling_model.png" /><br>
        <p>
          We theorized the biphasic E2F response to MYC is a built-in safety mechanism: normal,
          low levels of MYC stimulated by, for example, growth factors can drive cell cycle entry,
          while hyperactivated MYC, such as that observed in tumours, is unable to do the same.
          Thus, a built-in brake senses high MYC and prevents E2F from driving cell cycle responses.

        <p>
            At <a href="http://www.immunetrics.com/">Immunetrics</a>, I had the opportunity to jump in
            on projects for acute and chronic immune disorders. Pharma companies interested in rheumatoid arthritis therapies
            asked us to predict how a new drug in their pipeline would behave in a model that reliably reproduced previous trial results.
            These days, companies want tips on how many patients they would need in a trial to get a
            <a href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/glossary/statpow.html">
                good chance</a> of observing a pre-defined minimum effect to save them the expense of over-enrollment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our models spanned the molecular and cellular biology of the disease
            up to the relevant physiology of a "virtual" patient, which were then
            selected en masse for "virtual" clinical trials.
            Hurdles in making models realistic include the broad spectrum of patient responses to therapy
            set against the compendium of criteria test populations are known to satisfy (constraints).
            The modelling process involved many cycles of
            simulation, testing, and pruning to end up with a useable population.
            In more mathematical terms, this amounts to a large-scale
            constrained optimization problem in "patient space".
        </p>
        <p>
            One significant challenge we as modellers faced was in understanding how well a particular
            selection cycle was doing: Imagine testing thousands of patients for double digit types of therapies across
            several time points for a multitude of clinical measurements and you get the idea! I found
            trying to interpret reams of computer output in text format a dizzying experience and so created a suite of R
            scripts to grab and plot the data pouring out of our simulations database (below: red- simulation; blue - data).
        </p>
        <img class="caption img-responsive" src="/static/jeffreyvwong/images/visual/nlp.png" />
        <p>
            This analysis also included a variety of 2- and 3-dimensional analyses on proprietary clinical trial data provided
            by companies which, of course, I am unable to present. This 'slice-and-dice' approach enabled even
            better resolution in developing our "virtual" population.
