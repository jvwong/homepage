    <h3 class="item-title">Part I: Molecular biology and “big data”</h3>
    <p class="regular">
      My earliest memory of being drawn to biology was in high school when I learned about the factory-like order and precision of activities in the cell. Breaking down these mini-machines and figuring out their peculiarities seemed to be the best route to understanding them. In my undergraduate study in Molecular Genetics & Molecular Biology I got a chance to try my hand at basic laboratory research with Philip Marsden (St. Michael's Hospital) and studied the biology of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy with Peter N Ray (Hospital for Sick Children) in my final year. I was pretty smitten with bench work and all it entailed.
    </p>
    <p class="regular">
      I joined the laboratory of Henry Klamut (Medical Biophysics) for my doctoral research where for a gene therapy effort aimed at identifying genes important for cell-suicide triggered by radiation and DNA damage – pillars of standard cancer treatment. The rationale was that such “killer” genes could be reactivated in cancer cells in order to destroy them. I picked up the torch on a cell communication gene called Placental Transforming Growth Factor beta (PTGF-ß). My early work was aimed at delineating how therapeutic stimuli controlled PTGF-ß levels in breast cancer-derived cells. By most accounts (i.e. publication), this effort was a success.
    </p>
    <p class="regular">
      Next, I tried to find genes that PTGF-ß controlled in hopes of fashioning a guess at how it was triggering cell-suicide. I used DNA "microarrays" which at the time, was state-of-the-art technology enabling one to quantify alterations to every gene in a cell. However, I ended up with a big list of genes but little in terms of insight. Why the limited success? Beyond the numerous technical plaguing microarrays at the time were two main factors. First, there was a conceptual error that the quality and quantity of expression data would be sufficient to make solid guesses at why cells acted the way they did. Second, was  the recognition that the complexity and sheer mass of data being accumulated far outstripped our ability to make sense of them with words, pictures, intuition, experience, or dogged determination.
    </p>
    <p class="regular">
      It was a humbling experience. By 2000, we were already drowning in “Big” data. Where would understanding emerge?
    </p>

    <h3 class="item-title">Interlude: A more formal approach</h3>
    <p class="regular">
      I felt that we as biologists had much to gain from the rich body of thought in mathematics and computer science. I took up study in Applied Mathematics (Waterloo) and if anything, my time was a pretty fantastic meditation on diverse and often arcane fields of mathematics. I found a familiar place working in the laboratory on a project with Brian Ingalls (Applied Math) in “Synthetic Biology”, a nascent field that viewed biology from an engineering perspective. Regardless of the hype, derision, and confusion surrounding the field of Synthetic Biology, I appreciated attempts to use formal approaches to distill underlying principles that constrained the form, function, and behavior of biological systems. But what were these “rules”? Did they even exist?  Could we understand them?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="item">
    <h3 class="item-title">Part II: Modeling & simulation</h3>
    <p class="regular">
      I rebooted my research career with Lingchong You (Biomedical Engineering) at Duke. My background in molecular biology and mathematics were an nice fit for the collaborative environment. With Joseph Nevin's group (Genetics) we looked at how networks of genes manage to control normal cell division while preventing unchecked proliferation, a threshold that is often breached during the development of human tumors. This was followed with a purely computational study teasing out how networks trade-off between “multitasking” (more than one thing) and “performance” (ability to do any particular thing accurately).
    </p>
    <p class="regular">
      Beyond the specifics of any of the projects I worked on, I deeply appreciated how mathematics and computation could be used to serve understanding. On one hand, I was tasked with generating visual representations of novel, complex, and often multidimensional findings for journal articles. Effective visualization meant that I had to develop a mix of programming and artistic sensibility to corral results into form that was digestible and meaningful for reviewers and readers alike. On the other hand, I gained a deeper sense of how quantitative tools could be applied along with their dangers and limitations.
    </p>

  <div class="item">
    <h3 class="item-title">Part III: The “Real World”</h3>
    <p class="regular">
      I wanted to know how modeling might provide value outside of academic research and joined Immunetrics Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA) as a mathematical modeller. Immunetrics is, for all intents and purposes, a consulting group for clients with a stake in acute immune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.  The efforts at the company were split between two activities: On one side, developing the engine for a bedside clinical device providing hourly intelligence on patients with systemic infections or sepsis; On the other side were attempts to predict the clinical efficacy of development-phase rheumatoid arthritis drugs.
    </p>
    <p class="regular">
      At the core of each of these efforts are detailed models describing genes, cells, and organs that are combined in virtual “patients” which, in turn, are grouped to form virtual populations. The painstaking process of building and optimizing these enormous models to capture the results in published literature and clinical trials required a constellation of custom software be deployed in order to accomplish numerical simulation, optimization, machine learning, and visualization tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="regular">
      My modeling, simulation, and optimization skills were pushed into high gear by having to turn client's often vague questions and requests into functional modules that could be plugged into our main models. I was able to develop my data visualization skills by producing a suite that transformed the voluminous output of our simulations into graphical form. This visualization tool turned out to be inclusive: Using graphs rather than arcane text output of our simulation engine allowed management, non-mathematical team members, and modellers alike to discuss the a common simulation result. It also aided interpretability: The hundreds of parameters across multiple categories could be instantly evaluated and compared within and between simulation runs. Lastly, I was able experience how judicious application of mathematical and computational tools could be combined to provide real value.
